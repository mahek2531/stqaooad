Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation
Method 1: Using Formula V(G) = E - N + 2
Edges (E) = 14
Nodes (N) = 12
V(G) = 14 - 12 + 2 = 4
Method 2: Using Decision Points V(G) = D + 1
Decision points (D) = 4
V(G) = 4 + 1 = 5
Method 3: Using Regions
Number of regions = 5
V(G) = 5
Independent Paths (Basis Path Testing)
Path 1: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 12 (percentage >= 60)
Test Case: percentage = 65
Expected Output: "First Class with Distinction"
Path 2: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6 → 12 (50 <= percentage < 60)
Test Case: percentage = 55
Expected Output: "First Class"
Path 3: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 7 → 8 → 12 (40 <= percentage < 50)
Test Case: percentage = 45
Expected Output: "Second Class"
Path 4: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 7 → 9 → 10 → 12 (35 <= percentage < 40)
Test Case: percentage = 37
Expected Output: "Pass Class"
Path 5: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 7 → 9 → 11 → 12 (percentage < 35)
Test Case: percentage = 30
Expected Output: "Fail"
