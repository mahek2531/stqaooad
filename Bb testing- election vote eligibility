Problem Statement

Election voting rules:



| Age Group | Voting Status |

| 0 to 17 | Not eligible |

| 18 and above | Eligible |

| Negative age | Not eligible (Invalid) |



 Equivalence Classes



Valid Classes:

- VC1: Age 0 to 17 → Not eligible

- VC2: Age 18 and above → Eligible



Invalid Classes:

- IC1: Age < 0 → Invalid/Not eligible

- IC2: Age > 150 → Invalid (Unrealistic)

- IC3: Non-numeric input → Invalid



 Boundary Value Analysis



Boundaries Identified:

- Upper boundary of VC1: 17 years

- Lower boundary of VC2: 18 years



Boundary Values:

- Just below 18: 17 years

- At boundary 18: 18 years

- Just above 18: 19 years

 COMPARISON: BOUNDARY VALUE ANALYSIS vs EQUIVALENCE PARTITIONING

| Aspect | Boundary Value Analysis | Equivalence Partitioning |

| Focus | Boundaries between partitions | Representative values from partitions |

| Test Cases | Tests at, just above, just below boundaries | Tests one value from each partition |

| Coverage | Focuses on edge conditions | Focuses on typical conditions |

| Defect Detection | Finds boundary-related errors | Finds errors in processing logic |

| Number of Tests | More test cases | Fewer test cases |

| Example (Age 18-60) | Tests: 17, 18, 19, 59, 60, 61 | Tests: 25 (one from range) |
