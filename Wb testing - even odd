 Control Flow Diagram (CFD)



Nodes:

1. Start

2. Input number

3. Check number % 2 == 0

4. Print "Even"

5. Print "Odd"

6. Stop



Edges:

1 → 2

2 → 3

3 → 4 (True)

3 → 5 (False)

4 → 6

5 → 6

 Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation



Method 1: Using Formula V(G) = E - N + 2

- Edges (E) = 6

- Nodes (N) = 6

- V(G) = 6 - 6 + 2 = 2



Method 2: Using Decision Points V(G) = D + 1

- Decision points (D) = 1

- V(G) = 1 + 1 = 2



 Independent Paths



1. Path 1: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 6 (number is even)

   - Test Case: number = 10

   - Expected Output: "Even"



2. Path 2: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6 (number is odd)

   - Test Case: number = 7

   - Expected Output: "Odd"



 Test Cases



| Test Case ID | Input (number) | Expected Output | Path Covered |

| TC1 | 10 | Even | Path 1 |

| TC2 | 7 | Odd | Path 2 |

| TC3 | 0 | Even | Boundary |

| TC4 | -4 | Even | Negative Even |

| TC5 | -5 | Odd | Negative Odd |

| TC6 | 2 | Even | Smallest Even |

| TC7 | 1 | Odd | Smallest Odd |
